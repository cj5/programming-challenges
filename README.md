# Programming Challenges
A project where we can work on programming challenges we decide to take on while tracking eachother's progress.
## **Cloning the repository**
### *Option 1 (Sourcetree):*
* Download the Sourcetree desktop app: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com

After the auto-filled text, add "/what-you-want-your-project-to-be-called" I called mine "programming-challenges"
  * ***Name***: Adding the "/what-you-want..." will auto-fill this field with what you named your project above without you needing to edit this field at all

## **Key for naming throughout this README**
* `{your-name}` = 'alex', 'chris', or 'john'
* `{project-number}` = the number of the project. 1 = first project, 2 = second, etc.
* `{project-name}` = the name of the project, e.g. 'dartboard'

## **Recommended folder structure**
* `{your-name}`/
  * c`{project-number}`_`{project-name}`/...
    * c++/...
    * python/...
    * .../...
  * .../...

## **Recommended commit strategy**
* Create a new branch for each new challenge:
  * ***Sourcetree***: Select "Branch" and name the branch: `{your-name}`/c`{project-number}`_`{project-name}`
  * ***Command line***: git checkout -b `{your-name}`/c`{project-number}`_`{project-name}`
* Commit as much as you want to your branch
* When you're done with your challenge, merge your branch back into master.
