## **Cloning the repository**
### *Option 1 (Sourcetree):*
* Download the Sourcetree desktop app: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com
* Select "New" > "Clone from URL"
  * *Source URL*: https://github.com/cj5/programming-challenges.git
  * *Destination Path*: click the 3 dots off to the right of this field. Now choose where you want the project to be on your computer. Once you choose, the field will be auto-filled. After the auto-filled text, add "/what-you-want-your-project-to-be-called"
  * *Name*: Adding the "/what-you-want..." will auto-fill this field with what you named your project above without you needing to edit this field at all
* This will create your project directory, linked to Git, on your computer where you specified. Go to the project and open it in the IDE / text editor of your choice (See below for recommendations on IDEs).
